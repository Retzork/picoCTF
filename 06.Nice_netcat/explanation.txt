this problem teaches us to use nc command
its a way to talk to network connections, using TCP or UDP protocols

basic syntax :
    nc [options] [hostname] [port]

in this case, we were given a hostname and a port 
mercury.picoctf.net 43239

we talk to it with nc command:
    └─$ nc mercury.picoctf.net 43239

it print a string of number between 0 - 127
it indicate that its a decimal form of character

we want to get it clean in one line, so we use tr
    └─$ nc mercury.picoctf.net 43239 | tr '\n' ' '

now that its in one line, we can either decipher it in a website such:
    rapidtables.com

or we can translate it ourselfes with piping ^_^

to do that, we will use awk command, we will iterate through each character
print its character form for each of them

    for (i=1; i<=NF; i++)
this is the loop

    printf "%c", $i
this is the conversion

then we use it with piping along with the output of the string
    └─$ nc mercury.picoctf.net 43239 | tr '\n' ' ' | awk '{ for (i=1; i<=NF; i++) printf "%c", $i }'
