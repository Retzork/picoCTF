wget the files
if we cat the warm file, it display just a random binary string, in this case its an executable

and to execute the file we need to change the modifier:
    to do that, we can use the chmod command
    theres a lot of way to do it, but using 777 as the argument will change the modifier to all useable
    but it can also be done with +x (adding execute modifier) too
    └─$ chmod 777 warm

then we run the file with ./
    └─$ ./warm

it asks for -h argument 
    └─$ ./warm -h

then we get the flag
