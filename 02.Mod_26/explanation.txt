Cryptography - caesar cipher


copy the text

put it in a file :
    └─$ touch 'file'
    to make a new file

    └─$ cat > file
    to edit the file

    then paste the text to the file

    to exit the editor, press 'Ctrl + D'

then run this command :
    └─$ cat file | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'

    the | symbol is the symbol of piping, used to continuing an output as an input
    in this case, its piping the contents of 'file' to tr command

    the tr command in stands for "translate" or "transliterate." 
    it is primarily used to translate, delete, or squeeze characters.

    in this case, it shifts each letter in the input string by 13 positions in the alphabet

    this is a simple example of the ROT13 (rotate by 13 places) cipher
    which is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the letter 13 positions after it in the alphabet.

    'A-Za-z' represents the range of characters from A to Z in uppercase and lowercase.
    'N-ZA-Mn-za-m' represents the rotated characters, where each letter is shifted 13 positions ahead in the alphabet.
