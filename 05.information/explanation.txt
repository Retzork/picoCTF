download the photo
we want to check the photo's metadata, to do that we can use exiftool
you can download it first if you havent had it

then run to see the metadata :
    └─$ exiftool cat.jpg

it print all its metadata
if you see closely, the licence is in base64, we can assume that it may be something that has been ciphered

then we decipher it:
    i want to use piping to extract the ciphered text, to do that we can use grep
    └─$ exiftool cat.jpg | grep Licence

    running that will give us :
        License                         : cGljb0NURnt0aGVfbTN0YWRhdGFfMXNfbW9kaWZpZWR9
    
    but we only want the ciphered text
    we need to seperate the text with ": " seperation using awk
    we seperate the text to 2 part, before the ": " and after
    we want the latter, so we print the 2nd element

    └─$ exiftool cat.jpg | grep License | awk -F ": " '{print $2}'

    this will give us just the ciphered text
    lastly we need to decode it, we can use the base64 in linux to decipher it. base64 -d [string]
    
    └─$ exiftool cat.jpg | grep License | awk -F ": " '{print $2}' | base64 -d

    and that gives us the flag

grep is used to filter the text, in this case we want the line containing 'License'
awk with -F argument is used to seperate text, by default it uses whitespace
but in this case we want to seperate the string with ": " since its the last string before the text that we want
then it return 2 element, but we only want the 2nd element, so we print the 2nd with '{print $2}'
