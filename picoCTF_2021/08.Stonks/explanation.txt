Binary exploitation - Format String Vulnerabilities

wget the file and see its content

since we can only talk to the prgoram with the netcat, we need to make it give us the flag
in line 91 and 93 there is a Vulnerabilities
in line 91 we can input some string to the program
then it will print what we just input in line 93

but the function used to print the string that we previously input is vulnerable, since it doesnt check the type of its content
allowing us to inject a spesific character to get the previous data in the buffer

in scanf '%x' is used to request a hexadecimal
if printf recieve '%x' it will also request a hexadecimal to the buffer

so if we input lots of '%x' in line 91
the program will try to print lots of hexadecimal from the buffer
including the flag that is also stored in the buffer (see line 66 and 72)

so to solve this problem, we will input '1' to get to the vulnerable part
then input lots of '%x' until we get the flag in the hex form

we copy all the hex that is printed and decrypt it
i used cyberchef (https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/)

put all the hex in the input, then we drag the 'from hex' operation
we can already see it, but the ordering is swapped since its still in endian swapped

we need to reverse the swap with endian too, we drag the 'swap endianness' operation
its still in weird format, we will add more character in front of the input until it displays it correctly (i used 00)
