General SKill - encryption and decryption

download all the files with wget
ende.py is a cyphering tools
the flag is the ciphered flag with pw as password
so we need to run the ende.py to decipher the flag with pw

to do that, we run the ende.py:
    to do that, we need to run it with python3
    └─$ python3 ende.py

    if we run that, it will asks for an argument (-e or -d) and [file]
    since we want to decipher the flag, we use -d argument, and flag.txt.en as the file argument
    └─$ python3 ende.py -d flag.txt.en

    if we run that, it asks for the password, you can copy the password and paste it
    
    but in the ende.py we can see that we can input the password as the 3rd (0 indexed) argument
    so we can run this instead
    └─$ python3 ende.py -d flag.txt.en $(cat pw.txt)

    since the ende.py doesnt asks for the pw file name but instead the contents of it, we need to cat it first with that argument
    $(cat pw.txt) is similiar to piping, but its for the outside of the bracket instead of the right side of |
